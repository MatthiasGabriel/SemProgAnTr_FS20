\section{First steps in Agda}
The idea of this chapter is to give the reader a brief overview how Agda and external proofs (especially in agda) work. This is helpful as a contrast to the following chapters. 
In chapter \ref{section:internal_vs_external_verification} some differences are highlighted. The example therefore will most probably be based on the list to be able to compare it later with the vector type.

\subsection{Introduction example}
Placeholder: A short intoduction to agda. (Datatype definitions, pattern matching, normalization, etc).

\subsection{Total languages}
Placeholder: Agda and other languages based on type theory are total languages in the sense that a program e of type T will always terminate with a value in T. 
No runtime error can occur and no nonterminating programs can be written (unless explicitly requested by the programmer)\cite{AgdaReadTheDocs}.

\subsection{Proofs in the program}
Placeholder: Introduction to proofs (external verification) in agda with a few examples.
Curry-Howard isomorphism.
