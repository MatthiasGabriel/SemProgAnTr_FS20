\section{Conclusion}
In this publication, a short overview of dependent types and its usages in the concept of indexed datatypes as well as constructive proofs have been discussed.

As mentioned already in the introduction, it is not realistic, if not illusory, that every software developer uses dependent types. 
They come at a heavy price as it either makes type checking undecidable or restrict the possible programs, as seen at the example of Agda.
Additionally proving properties about a program can take huge amounts of effort and take a lot of practice.
It is uncertain if many developers and companies are willing to invest this effort and profit of the additional safety that dependent types bring.

However, there certainly exists software, where the benefits outweigh the additional costs. 
Especially in security-relevant software the possibility to prove properties can be worthwhile.

In my opinion, dependent types will be a special language feature, not used by the majority of developers, at least for the next few years. 
Even though it is reasonable to think that the community around dependent types will grow and in the future, more projects will use dependent types as an additional help to develop high-quality software.
