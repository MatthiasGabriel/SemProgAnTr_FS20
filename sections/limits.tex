Haskell, as implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), has been adding new type-level programming features for some time. Many of these features---chiefly: generalized algebraic datatypes (GADTs), type families, kind polymorphism, and promoted datatypes---have brought Haskell to the doorstep of dependent types. Many dependently typed programs can even currently be encoded, but often the constructions are painful. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Eisenberg16}
