\section{Dependent Types}
\subsection{Introduction to dependent types}
An introduction to dependent types in theory. Similar to Chapter 5.1 of \cite{10.1145/2841316}, but my objective is to be a little bit more general.

The primary objective is to present the basics of the feature and it's primary promises.

\subsection{Example in Agda}
"Hello world" of dependently typed programming aka vector append aswell as at least one example that shows the main benefit in relation to a "normal" list.
This will most probably be the "nth"-function.

\subsection{Advanced theory}
Some more advanced features such as $\Sigma$-types and $\Pi$-types.

\subsection{Advanced Example in Agda}
A more advanced example in agda. Such as brown tree or even parts of the huffman encoding.
