One of the most important purposes of types in statically typed languages is to detect programming errors already at compile time.
This reduces the error rate at runtime.
Dependent types allow types to base not only on types, as in parametric polymorphism, but also on values.
This enables the programmer to encode additional information in the type system and prevent further runtime errors.

The most important feature dependent types enable is the connection to logic also known as \emph{Curryâ€“Howard correspondence}.
It allows the programmer to express \emph{propositions as types} and corresponding \emph{proofs as programs}.

This publication contains an introduction to the concept of dependent types together with examples in the programming language Agda.
